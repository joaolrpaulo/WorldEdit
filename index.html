      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This project is for a college subject (Software Arquitecture), and we want achieve some goals like:</p>
        <p>We want to focus on the mechanical part of this project.</p>


      <h2 id="sec0">User View</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>World Edit, What is it?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        WorldEdit is a worldwide known framework for Minecraft, between many features, it holds some interesting ones:
      <ul>
        <li>Select a region of a map (like pinpoint two positions in map)</li>
        <li>Fix map problems, such as broken water, missing snow, broken walls and much more!</li>
        <li>Make big constructions with two clicks</li>
        <li>Change blocks from one type to another, like from grass to diamond</li>
        <li>Create objects with one click, e.g, trees, spheres, animals</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id="sec1">Developer View</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Include here chunk explanation.</p>



      <h1>Features <small>Very summarized overview with main functions</small></h1>
      <hr>
      <p>We will omit most command sintaxe. However, a detailed overview of all commands
        can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit">official documentation</a>.</p>


      <h2 id="sec2">Region Operations</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>It's possible to perform a long range of region operations with World Edit.</p>
      <p>To perform those kind of operations, the user is required to select a Cuboid area. This is done by selecting
      two points which will create a rectangular selecion (other shapes and formats can also be used).</p>
      <p>Using the selected area, we can perform changes like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting Blocks</li>
        <li>Replacing Blocks (example below)</li>
        <li>Create walls</li>
        <li>Place overlays over a range of blocks</li>
        <li>Stacking (example below)</li>
        <li>Move a set of blocks</li>
        <li>Smooth an area, for example, a rough mountain</li>
        <li>Naturalize, make an area look more natural with grass and dirt</li>
        <li>Placing flora, scatter tall grass and flowers for grass or cactus for sand</li>
        <li>Deform regions, applying a user defined equation</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="blockquote-box blockquote-primary">
        <h4>
          Region Selecion</h4>
        <p>

      <h2 id="sec3">Clipboard</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>WorldEdit provides the ability to have a clipboard that allows users to copy, paste and even save an area.
      These cuboid areas can be saved into a file (<i>schematic files</i>) under a storage at
        <code>\plugins\WorldEdit\schematics\</code> and loaded at any time with a simple command. The copy-paste
      functionality saves the cuboid area in cache, in the user Local Session until we decide to paste it.</p>
      <p>Some examples of clipboard operations are:</p>

      <h2 id="sec4">Generation</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Generation tools provide us the ability to create a set of shapes (can be generated with mathematics) up to
      a full forest.</p>
      <p>This section is focused in creating architectural elements, like for example a sphere or a pyramid. WorldEdit
      is also able to generate a forest like <code>/forestgen 10</code>:</p>
      <blockquote>The command searches the area around you, controlled by the size parameter,
        and it will descend in elevation a bit in order to find grass or dirt (trees will only be generated
        on top of those two blocks),
        but it will not ever go up above your feet.</blockquote>
      <p>The generation algoritm was made clever to develop a forest according to surrouding area conditions. However,
      it is not possible to get 100% density (a tree in every spot) as Notch's (creator of Minecraft)
      tree algorithm won't permit that.</p>

      <h2 id="sec5">Utility</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>If we saw a lot of interesting features, it doesn't end here! Utility joins a lot of useful functions we often
      manually struggle for. In sum, we want to distinguish tools like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Draining liquids</li>
        <li>Filling pits</li>
        <li>Removing annoying mobs</li>
        <li>Extinguish fire</li>
        <li>Brushes: build from far away</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the most interesting ones is the brushes. As the name says, we cannot only paint with it but we can
      also generate blocks or shapes to where we are pointing to (terraforming). It also allows us to
        smooth rough mountains and level terrains.</p>

      <h1>Architecture</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This is the core part of our documentation. We aim to demystify the big tree of packages this project
      consists on. Expand the software and provide other developers, the required knowledge
      to be aware of the pillars it holds.</p>
      <p>
        In the following diagrams we tried to only represent the important classes or packages grouped
        among all the project as this is a very complex software.
        A full class diagram wouldn't be user-friendly, so we created a views joining all important related classes
        aiming to make it easier to understand and explain what's happening.</p>


      <h2 id="sec8">Logical View <small>Key parts and functional components</small></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In sum, this project has three big packages (or Schemas):</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joaolrpaulo/WorldEdit/tree/introduction/worldedit-core">WorldEdit-Core
        </a>, this is the main project. It’s independent from any adapter.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joaolrpaulo/WorldEdit/tree/introduction/worldedit-bukkit">WorldEdit-Bukkit
        </a>, the adapter redirected to the Bukkit platform.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/joaolrpaulo/WorldEdit/tree/introduction/worldedit-forge">WorldEdit-Forge
        </a>, the adapter redirected to the Forge platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As for these last two, they are required to support WorldEdit on Minecraft through other platforms,
        responsible for loading all the required plugins and create the functional environment.
        All the classes that we didn't represent here, are the ones that we don't consider as
        fundamental for the analysis.</p>

      <h3>Command Manager <small>A clever way of dealing with storing and detecting commands</small></h3>
      <hr>
      <p>WorldEdit's way of managing commands is very sagaciously organized. From our study and previous knowledge
      with Bukkit, we found out this command architecture is also featured in other author's plugins.
      One of the main reasons is the simplicity of organizing all the required commands without having them all in a
      class with a massive amount of <i>if statements</i>.</p>

      <p>It consists in having a manager for commands (Command Manager Class) which will map each command string or alias
      with corresponding method. The manager can register any command class, and will fetch method annotations like
      the example below:</p>

      <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
        @Command<span style="color: black;">(
          aliases = { <span style="color: blue;">"/line"</span> },
          usage = <span style="color: blue;">"[block] [thickness]"</span>,
          desc = <span style="color: blue;">"Draws a line segment between cuboid selection corners"</span>,
          help = <span style="color: blue;">"Help will be described here"</span>,
          flags = <span style="color: blue;">"h"</span>,
          min = <span style="color: orange;">1</span>,
          max = <span style="color: orange;">2</span>
        )
        </span>
        @CommandPermissions("worldedit.region.line")
        @Logging(REGION)
        <span style="color: darkblue;">public void</span> <span style="color: black;">line</span>(arguments) <span style="color: black;">{</span>
          <span style="color: grey;">// Command method will describe here</span>
        <span style="color: black;">}</span>
      </code>

      <p></p>
      <p>Command Manager will register alias <i>"/line"</i> with method <i>"line(args)"</i>. Next time the user inputs a
      command, manager will (call a dispatcher to) find which stored method is related to the input
      (methods that are mapped with their aliases in a data structure):</p>

      <pre>
        <span style="color: blue;">MappedCommands</span>&lt;<span style="color: orange;">String, Method</span>&gt; contains

        &lt;<span style="color: orange;">"line"</span>, <span style="color: blue;">public void</span> line(arguments)</span>&gt;</pre>

      <p>This architecture is extremly usefull to avoid code polution and keep different commands separated per class or
      category.</p>

      <h1>Storage</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>YAML</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>YAML is a encoding format that makes data more readable by human beings,
        it was inspired in languages suchs as XML, Python, Perl, and Internet Message Protocol.
        It was created by Clark Evans, Brian Ingerson and Oren Ben-Kiki, by the year of 2000.</p>
      <p>YAML (pronounced as "yammel"), was designed with a very proper idea,
        that every data could be represented by a set of list, hashes, and simple values.
        YAML only uses unicode characters (UTF-8 and UTF-16).YAML is relatively simple to use.
        The respective file holds the information in a
        indented format like the example below:</p>
      <pre>
        Blocks:
        - Grass
        - Sand
        - Stone

        Users:
          Pedro: '- Developer'
          Marco: '* Second Developer'
          João: '# Developer'
          Andreia: '\ Developer'</pre>
      <p>Within the domain of the Java language, YAML fields can be easily accessed using:</p>
      <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap;>
        <span style="color: darkorange;">yamlFile.getStringList</span>(<span style="color: blue">"Blocks"</span>);
        // Will return a list ['Grass', 'Sand', 'Stone']
      </code>
      <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
        <span style="color: darkorange;">yamlFile.getConfigurationSection</span>(<span style="color: blue">'Users'</span>)<span style="color: darkorange;">.getKeys</span>(<span style="color: blue;">false</span>)
        // Will return ['Pedro', 'Marco', 'Joao', 'Andreia']
        // We can now do:

        <span style="color: darkorange;">yamlFile.getString</span>(<span style="color: blue;">"Users.Pedro"</span>);
        // Will return '- Developer'
      </code>
      <p></p>
      <p>In the context of the project that we have been reviewing during this semester,
        YAML is used to store some configurations related to multiple aspects such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User data</li>
        <li>World data</li>
        <li>Blocks data</li>
        <li>Command restrictions</li>
        <li>Zone restrictions, among others.</li>
      </ul>
      An more particular example can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sk89q/WorldEdit/blob/master/

      <h1>Contributing</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>WorldEdit is open to community contributions. It's also usefull if you need to create an adapter for your
      software. However, your code must be efficient and tested.</p>
      <p>Before cloning the project and start writing code, remember the checklist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have all tabs been replaced into four spaces? Are indentations 4-space wide?</li>
        <li>Have I written proper Javadocs for my public methods? Are the @param and @return fields actually filled out?</li>
        <li>Have I git rebased my pull request to the latest commit of the target branch?</li>
        <li>Have I combined my commits into a reasonably small number (if not one) commit using git rebase?</li>
        <li>Have I made my pull request too large? Pull requests should introduce small sets of changes at a time.
          Major changes should be discussed with the team prior to starting work.</li>
        <li>Are my commit messages descriptive?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Branching Model</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>If you are not used to git, make sure to also be aware of their branching model.</p>
      <p>To avoid consecutive merges, commit disorganization and code loss, WorldEdit follows successfull branch model
      as the figure below.</p>
      <p>The develop branch (integration) is the core part where developers are working. Every time a developer
        needs to create a new feature, they open a new branch, for example <code>feature/replaceblocks</code>.
        After the new feature has been completed, that branch can now be merged back to develop.</p>

      <p>Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute
        dotting of i’s and crossing t’s. When we finish a release branch, we merge it to master.
        The changes made on the release branch also need to be merged back into develop,
        so that future releases also contain these bug fixes.</p>

      <p>Hotfix branches are required for critical bugfixes. When completed they need to be merged back into master
      and develop must also receive those changes.</p>

      <p>This is sucessfull git production!</p>

      <h1 id="sec13">Improving WorldEdit</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Minecraft, more specific, the Bukkit Adapter has known limitations related to asynchronous world modification.
        If we try to run block modifications in a separate thread we will get an exception like:</p>

      <blockquote style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>[Timer-51/WARN]: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Asynchronous block remove!</blockquote>

      <p>Derived from this, World Edit core runs every task using the main thread.
        This decision can cause complications when performing tasks with a massive number of blocks.
        As for example, if we try to paste a schematic with 1 million blocks running World Edit in a server
        with the following specifications:</p>

      <blockquote style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
        Intel Xeon E3 1225v2 3.2 GHz+

        4GB of RAM allocated to the server
      </blockquote>

      <p>The server will stop responding after a few seconds, possibly causing world chunk errors.</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        After studying the problem, it's possible to understand we can archieve an asynchronous operation
        and still avoid to use a separate thread. We can do this by scheduling the number of blocks per a unit of time.
        Let's take again our example of 1 million blocks. If we define a static constant of <strong>5000 blocks
        per each second</strong>, we can schedule consecutive tasks and complete our task in about 3.33 minutes.</p>

       <pre>
         <strong>Task #1</strong>
         Modify 5000 blocks
         Run now

         <strong>Task #2</strong>
         Modify 5000 blocks
         Run after 1 second

         <strong>Task #3</strong>
         Modify 5000 blocks
         Run after 2 seconds</pre>
      <p>

      <p>After 200 tasks, we will complete our job. This method will give us the ability to see the progress
      of our operation and avoid any world/chunk errors if the server gets shutdown. The job can be saved to
      the disk and sustained any time.</p>



      <h1 id="sec14">Conclusion <small>What did we learn?</small></h1>
      <hr>
      <p>WorldEdit is a very complex project. We enriched a lot of our knowledge about organized software
      architecture by getting deeper into this project. It leaves us surprised studying such clever
      code organization where most of the times people tend to find fixes.</p>

      <p>In the logical and development architectures, more specifically, the managers and adapters, we were able
      to learn a new diverse way of how to create multi-platform compatible software using adapters. Along with that,
      we saw new ideas to centralize complex command classes, like the Command Manager does.</p>

      <p>We, programmers, are used to, in our world, start something from <b>scratch</b>. We have to make lots of
        <b>choices</b> while building software, some of them may not be the best if we are not used to the
        <b>environment we are programming in</b>.
      Most of the times we end up having to create a <i>"recode" version</i> of our project because we find out we can have a
        <b>better architecture</b> than what we started in. How many times this <s>doesn't</s> happen?</p>

      <p>In the real word, an architect cannot fail on this aspects. It can lead to a disaster and lots of
        repercussions.</p>

      <p>Programmers are always able to mold their project. But the moral in all this is that we can <b>greatly improve
      our workflow</b> and save a lot of time if we make it right on our base software architecture. Having a <b>solid
      architecture is the key to have a strong organized software</b>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Although software has no mass, it does have weight, weight that can ossify any system by creating inertia to change and introducing crushing complexity.
        <small>Grady Booch</small>
      </blockquote>

      And that's what we've learned!
