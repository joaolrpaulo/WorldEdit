# Introduction

## Propose of this project

This project is for a college subject (Software Arquitecture), and we want achieve
some goals like:

* [4+1 Architectural view model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model)
  * [Logical view]()
  * [Development view]()
  * [Process view]()
  * [Physical view]()
  * [Scenarios]()

### [WorldEdit? What it is?](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit)

   WorldEdit is a world editor for Minecraft which makes users life way more easy by helping on some essentials things in
game, like building structures, spawning objects, and manipule them, among others.
In this analysis we will talk about about how this ingame framework works, and how it is implemetend "behind the hood".

It holds some interesting features:

* Select a region of a map (like pinpoint two positions in map)
* Fix map problems, such as broken water, missing snow, broken walls and much more!
* Make big constructions with two clicks
* Change blocks from one type to another, like from grass to diamond
* Create objects with one click, e.g, trees, spheres, animals

In this chapter, we will study the way that WorldEdit is organized, with help from different architecture views (more exactly, 4+1 Architecture view), and his stackholders. During this analysis, we pretend to discuss about how we could improved this framework, aswell as giving some help to sk89q (WorldEdit main developer), and his team.
