#Conclusion
###### What did we learn?

WorldEdit is a very complex project. We enriched a lot of our knowledge about organized software architecture by getting deeper into this project. It leaves us surprised studying such clever code organization where most of the times people tend to find fixes.

In the logical and development architectures, more specifically, the managers and adapters, we were able to learn a new diverse way of how to create multi-platform compatible software using adapters. Along with that, we saw new ideas to centralize complex command classes, like the Command Manager does.

We, programmers, are used to, in our world, start something from **scratch**. We have to make lots of **choices** while building software, some of them may not be the best if we are not used to the **environment we are programming in**. Most of the times we end up having to create a "recode" version of our project because we find out we can have a **better architecture** than what we started in. How many times this ~~doesn't~~ happen?

In the real word, an architect cannot fail on this aspects. It can lead to a disaster and lots of repercussions.

Programmers are always able to mold their project. But the moral in all this is that we can **greatly improve our workflow** and save a lot of time if we make it right on our base software architecture. Having a **solid architecture is the key to have a strong organized software**.

And that's what we've learned!
