# Features

We will omit most command sintaxe. However, a detailed overview of all commands can be found in the [official documentation](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit).

## Region Operations

It's possible to perform a long range of region operations with World Edit.

To perform those kind of operations, the user is required to select a Cuboid area. This is done by selecting two points which will create a rectangular selecion (other shapes and formats can also be used).

Using the selected area, we can perform changes like:

* Setting Blocks
* Replacing Blocks (example below)
* Create walls
* Place overlays over a range of blocks
* Stacking (example below)
* Move a set of blocks
* Smooth an area, for example, a rough mountain
* Naturalize, make an area look more natural with grass and dirt
* Placing flora, scatter tall grass and flowers for grass or cactus for sand
* Deform regions, applying a user defined equation

**Region Selecion**
```
Usage: //wand [Gives user an item that can be used to flag first position (left click) and second position (right click)]
Usage: //pos1 or //pos2 [Selects first and second positions]
```
