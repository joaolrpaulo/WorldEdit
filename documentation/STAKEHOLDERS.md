# Stakeholders

WorldEdit is made of a large necessity from the community all around the world running vanilla minecraft or Bukkit/Forge servers.
The project runs on a voluntary base and is featured in a large community of plugins called [Bukkit](https://www.bukkit.org).

It's almost impossible for the community to imagine world or block management without WorldEdit, we can conclude this by the large amount
of users depending on it `13,963,291 downloads on 28/05/2016`.
